            The fifth session of GSLMUN, held on December 2019, was a great success with over 750 participants from all
            over the world. GSLMUN, with its highly motivated organizer board and international student officer and
            press team, ensures a smooth process before, during and after the conference through innovative practices
            such as the online approval panel and online participant system, which in accordance with our green policy
            helps minimize paper waste. We are certain that GSLMUN will continue to maintain its high quality of debate
            and the friendly atmosphere among its international participants in the upcoming year. Our aim is to gather
            enthusiastic participants and provide them a chance to make connections from around the world, enjoy a
            magnificent city, and engage in quality debates at the same time. We hope to achieve this goal by blending
            our own experience as a MUN club with your participation, and as a result, creating a productive and
            enjoyable environment in a peaceful atmosphere. Our conference abides by the HMUN rules of procedure within
            its committees.

            GSLMUN has been and will be held in Galatasaray High School,The second oldest educational institution
            inTurkey. Our school,with its 153 year old campus which is one of the signature landmarks of Istanbul will
            guarantee that our visitors will have an unforgettable experience.
