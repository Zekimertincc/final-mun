        <p class="main"">
                        Most Distinguished Future Participants of Galatasaray Lisesi Model United Nations Conference 2021,
            
            We, Elif Akoğlu and Nisan Başçiftçi, hereby standing as the Secretaries-General of Galatasaray Lisesi Model United Nations Conference 2021, invite you all in the name of our Academic and Organization Teams to the sixth annual session of Galatasaray Lisesi Model United Nations Conference (GSLMUN), during which you will have an indelible experience at the heart of an historical metropolitan, Istanbul. GSLMUN has authenticated its quality with its first conference in 2015. Now, it is our turn, as our team and us, to further enhance our conference with the feedback received and guarantee the high-quality experience. We are bigger, better, and stronger than ever.
            
            Throughout centuries, Istanbul has taken the contemplation of others as the center of the civilization. It is where you can embrace a ton variety of cultures, traditions, beliefs by just wandering around and observing the environment. Holding a conference at this spot has its perks, being close to the medial of current events. During this year’s conference, this is how we are planning on affixing different cultures: a conference during the Christmas in Istanbul, with special Christmas themes. We would like to thank our Directors-General Mesut Gölmez and Ege Karaarslan for their special focus on the organizational matters by planning a noteworthy conference embellished with special social events, and in-conference activities and our Deputy Secretaries-General Yusuf Eker and Kıral Ozan Kranda for the teamwork that we have managed to perform.
            
            GSLMUN 2021 will consist of ten committees, seven of them being special and three of them being General Assembly committees. Delegates will resolve most controversial and important international problems in Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC), Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee (SOCHUM) The Special Political and Decolonization Committee (SPECPOL), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and World Health Organization (WHO). Experienced delegates are welcomed to apply for more challenging special committees, which consist of NATO, Historical Security Council, Arab League, Maximilien Robespierre’s Cabinet, and Joint Crisis Committee.
            
            All being said, we would like to conclude by welcoming you, our prospective participant with a crucial quote. As John Foster Dulles stated: “The United Nations represents not a final stage in the development of world order, but only a primitive stage. Therefore, its primary task is to create the conditions which will make possible a more highly developed organization.” Furthermore, as Model UNers it is our aim to stimulate the primitive stage in the development of world order at its very best, which we will achieve in GSLMUN 2021. Get on down to GSLMUN. That’s us. Don’t even hesitate, don’t even worry, don’t even give it a second thought.
            
            We once again invite you all to GSLMUN 2021 and are looking forward to welcoming you in Istanbul, Turkey.
